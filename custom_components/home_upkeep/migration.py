One-time importer for existing add-on data.

Imports from copies of the add-on's `list_<id>.json` files
(`{version, list, tasks[]}`) — the only path that actually works for a real
install: the add-on only exposes itself via Home Assistant's ingress proxy,
so there's no plain HTTP endpoint this integration (or an external script)
could call instead. Since the storage models are the ones being ported, the
transform is essentially identity and original int IDs are preserved (see
`store.HomeUpkeepStore.async_import`).
